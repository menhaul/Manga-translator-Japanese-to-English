# Manga-translator-Japanese-to-English
Basic Manga translator from japanese to english.

-Download zip.

-extract zip

-put it in your browsers extension

-(press hold) shift + s and m1 (mouse 1) button at the same time.(its for not highlighting the page.)

-while pressing select the place you want to translate.

-let it go and it will create a box with the translation.

I dont know how true the translation is but it does the job for me anyway.

I used tesseract.js to do this but if you want to develop this you are free to do so.
